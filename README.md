# scScarTrace

Collection of scripts used to extract scar clones in scar libraries produced with scScarTrace. 
Initially, we need pair-end fastq files and the scripts produce a final table of scar-percentage per cell, where each cell is assigned to a give clone determined by scar content. This table can undergo further filtering, such as removing clones with less than a given number of cells, or merging together clones with similar scar content. 

Please, follow the pdf manual and the sample code for further information.
